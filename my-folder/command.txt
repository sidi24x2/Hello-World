Git : It is a version controlled system where the changes in files are kept on track. 
If we want to check any older version of the file we can use it. 
Commits : These are the snapshots of the file system. It saves the file at a particular point i.e what it is doing.
Git track changes with the help of commits, we can always go back to the last version. when we are in the staging 
area we can make changes and then go back to the untracked area. 
3 Stages of GIT are : 
Untracked area (Working Tree) : this is the place where we work.
Staging area (Index) : It act as a connector b/w working tree and committed stage.
Committed Stage : It have all the commits ( versions ).
